# Project-Facial-keypoint-detection

Project Overview
In this project, Weâ€™ll combine our knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face!

Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. It finds its application in tracking
faces in images and videos, analysis of facial expressions,detection of dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis,face recognition, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition etc... The goal is look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face. Some examples of these keypoints are pictured below.

Facial keypoints (also called facial landmarks) are the small magenta dots shown on each of the faces in the image above. In each training and test image, there is a single face and **68 keypoints, with coordinates (x, y), for that face**.  These keypoints mark important areas of the face: the eyes, corners of the mouth, the nose, etc. These keypoints are relevant for a variety of tasks, such as face filters, emotion recognition, pose recognition, and so on. Here they are, numbered, and you can see that specific ranges of points match different portions of the face.
